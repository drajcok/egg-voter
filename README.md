## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Run `npm run backend` for the backend server. (On Windows, in a bash shell use `$ ./node_modules/nodemon/bin/nodemon.js server.js`) The Angular dev server will send all /api requests to the express server running on port 3000. Nodemon watches the server.js file and reloads the server on changes.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
For services, `ng g s service-name --module app` to generate a new service and provide it in the app module.
Use the `-d` flag at the end of a generate command to view output of what the command will do without actually performing any changes.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
